/F1 11 Tf
(1. Inventory Carrying Costs) Tj
0 -15 Td
(   - Products held in QC quarantine represent tied-up working capital) Tj
0 -15 Td
(   - For a mid-size dairy: 5,000 units/day x $10/unit = $50,000/day in hold) Tj
0 -15 Td
(   - 72-hour hold = $150,000 constantly tied up in quarantine inventory) Tj
0 -25 Td
(2. Warehouse and Cold Storage) Tj
0 -15 Td
(   - Quarantine space costs $15-25 per pallet per day for refrigerated storage) Tj
0 -15 Td
(   - Additional labor for segregation, tracking, and movement) Tj
0 -15 Td
(   - Opportunity cost: space could be used for production or finished goods) Tj
0 -25 Td
(3. Spoilage and Shelf Life Impact) Tj
0 -15 Td
(   - Every day in hold is a day off the sellable shelf life) Tj
0 -15 Td
(   - Short-dated products command lower prices or face rejection) Tj
0 -15 Td
(   - Extended hold increases spoilage risk, especially for fresh products) Tj
